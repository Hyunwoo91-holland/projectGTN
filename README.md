[Proposal for sports equipment sharing website, 
‘Get Things you need Near you’]



1.	Introduction
 For the sports lover, sports equipment is essential for their effective work-out and depending on the phase of the work-out, sometimes many different tools are needed. However, they are not easy to carry or not very affordable. In this case, we need to find another way to borrow sports items in the right time they need them.  
2.	Concept
•	Get the things you need near your house
It is an online-based local community that makes it possible for local to share their sports equipment with the neighbors or those who live in the city or town.
•	Share the tools that you don’t need for your work-out
User can share their equipment by posting these on the website. It will be rewarded by receiving points from the promoting program. 

3.	Goal(requirements)
a.	User can make an account, login and logout.
b.	User can post, edit and delete their sports equipment for rent with photos, texts, location and a price per day of rental.
c.	User can see an overview of all items available for rent.
d.	User can select a rental period for a piece of equipment and rent it for this period.
e.	The days where the item is already rented out to someone else are blocked in the selection.
f.	User can receive some points(rewards) as a return of the rental.
g.	User may receive a notification if someone want to rent their items.
